**Bounty Prompt Extension** is a Burp Suite extension developed by Bounty Security that leverages advanced AI technology integrated via Burp AI. It enables users to generate intelligent security testing prompts by analyzing selected HTTP requests and responses from various sources within Burp Suite. The extension supports a wide range of HTTP tags, allowing you to automatically include specific parts of HTTP traffic (such as headers, parameters, bodies, and cookies) in your prompts, streamlining both automated and manual penetration testing workflows.

1.  Navigate to **Extender > Extensions**.
2.  Click **Add**.
3.  Select **Extension Type: Java**.
4.  Click **Select file...** and choose the compiled JAR file from the repository (or the directory containing your compiled classes).
5.  Click **Next** and wait for the extension to load. You should see the extension named **Bounty Prompt Extension** in the list.

3\. Launch the Extension
------------------------

1.  Once loaded, a new tab (e.g., **Bounty Prompt**) will appear in Burp Suite.
2.  The extension’s output tab will display welcome messages.

4\. Configuration
-----------------

The extension allows you to configure AI prompts. Each prompt consists of the following fields:

*   **Title:** The title of the prompt.
*   **Author:** Your identifier (e.g., `@bountysecurity`).
*   **Output Type:** Choose between _Issue_ or _Prompt Output_.
*   **Severity:** For issues – options include _Information_, _Low_, _Medium_, and _High_.
*   **Confidence:** For issues – options include _Certain_, _Firm_, and _Tentative_.
*   **System Prompt:** Instructions for the AI to define its role (e.g., "You are a web security expert specialized in SQL injection analysis...").
*   **User Prompt:** The question or task for the AI. This field may include special tags (see Supported HTTP Tags).

5\. AI Prompts
--------------

Configure your prompts in the extension UI. For issue-related prompts, set the Output Type to _Issue_ and select the desired Severity and Confidence levels. For prompts that display output, set the Output Type to _Prompt Output_.

6\. Supported HTTP Tags
-----------------------

You can include the following tags in the User Prompt to automatically insert specific HTTP properties into your prompt:

*   **\[HTTP\_Requests\]:** Includes the complete HTTP request text.
*   **\[HTTP\_Requests\_Headers\]:** Includes only the HTTP request headers.
*   **\[HTTP\_Requests\_Parameters\]:** Includes the query string parameters from the HTTP request URL.
*   **\[HTTP\_Request\_Body\]:** Includes the HTTP request body (if available).
*   **\[HTTP\_Responses\]:** Includes the complete HTTP response text.
*   **\[HTTP\_Response\_Headers\]:** Includes only the HTTP response headers.
*   **\[HTTP\_Response\_Body\]:** Includes the HTTP response body.
*   **\[HTTP\_Status\_Code\]:** Includes the HTTP response status code (e.g., 200, 404).
*   **\[HTTP\_Cookies\]:** Includes cookies extracted from the HTTP request or response.

7\. Usage
---------

1.  **Configure Prompts:** In the extension UI, add or edit prompts with the required fields.
2.  **Select Requests/Responses:** In Burp Suite, select one or more HTTP requests/responses from the Site Map or via the context menu.
3.  **Trigger a Prompt:**
    *   Right-click to open the context menu and choose the **Prompts** menu.
    *   Select a prompt to send the selected HTTP data to the AI.
4.  **Issue Creation:** If the prompt’s Output Type is set to _Issue_, an issue will be created in Burp Suite against the static host `http://bountyprompt_extension.com`. For a single request, the issue will include the full endpoint; for multiple requests, only the domain (host) is used.
5.  **Review Results:**
    *   For _Prompt Output_ type, review the AI responses in the extension’s output area.
    *   For _Issue_ type, review the created issues in the Burp Suite Issues tab.
