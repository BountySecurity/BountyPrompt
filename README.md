----------------------
**Bounty Prompt** is an open-source **Burp Suite** extension developed by **Bounty Security** that leverages advanced AI technology through both **Burp AI** and **Groq Cloud**. It allows you to save pre-configured AI prompts and automatically attach selected HTTP requests and responses from Burp Suite. This combined data is sent to the AI engine, which analyzes your HTTP traffic and provides tailored security testing insights—helping to streamline vulnerability assessments and penetration testing workflows.

**Bounty Prompt** not only delivers tailored security testing insights, but also actively responds to your specific queries. For instance, it can detect sensitive information within responses, scrutinize parameters to pinpoint potential vulnerabilities, and more. Moreover, the extension supports a comprehensive set of HTTP tags, allowing you to seamlessly incorporate key elements of HTTP traffic—such as headers, parameters, bodies, and cookies—directly into your prompts.

## Usage with Burp AI
----------------------
**WARNING!** You need a **Burp Suite Pro Early Adopter 2025.2 version** or newer compatible with Burp AI:<br/>

1. Install the extension.
2. Specify the `prompts` directory in the **Config** tab.
3. Enable **Use AI** in the extension:

![BountyPrompt5](/images/BountyPrompt5.png)

4. Select the desired HTTP requests/responses in Burp Suite.
5. Right-click and choose the **Burp AI** menu option.
6. The prompt will be sent to Burp AI, and the resulting output or issue will be displayed accordingly.

## Usage with Groq Cloud
-----------------------
To use Groq Cloud:

1. Ensure you have a valid Groq Cloud API key and select the desired AI model from the configuration.
2. Specify the `prompts` directory in the **Config** tab..
3. Select the desired HTTP requests/responses in Burp Suite.
4. Right-click and choose the **Groq Cloud** menu option.
5. If the Groq API key is not configured or is empty, a popup will prompt you to configure it in the Config tab.
6. The prompt will be sent to Groq Cloud using the specified API key and model. The output or created issue will then be displayed within Burp Suite.

## Load the Extension
----------------------

1. Navigate to **Extender > Extensions**.
2. Click **Add**.
3. Select **Extension Type: Java**.
4. Click **Select file...** and choose the compiled JAR file from the repository (or the directory containing your compiled classes).
5. Click **Next** and wait for the extension to load. You should see the extension named **Bounty Prompt** in the list.

## Configuration
-----------------

The extension allows you to configure AI prompts. Each prompt consists of the following fields:

* **Title:** The title of the prompt.
* **Author:** Your identifier (e.g., `@bountysecurity`).
* **Output Type:** Choose between _Issue_ or _Prompt Output_.
* **Severity:** For issues – options include _Information_, _Low_, _Medium_, and _High_.
* **Confidence:** For issues – options include _Certain_, _Firm_, and _Tentative_.
* **System Prompt:** Instructions for the AI to define its role (e.g., "You are a web security expert specialized in SQL injection analysis...").
* **User Prompt:** The question or task for the AI. This field may include special tags (see Supported HTTP Tags).

## AI Prompts
--------------

Configure your prompts in the extension UI. For issue-related prompts, set the Output Type to _Issue_ and select the desired Severity and Confidence levels. For prompts that display output, set the Output Type to _Prompt Output_.

## Supported HTTP Tags
-----------------------

You can include the following tags in the User Prompt to automatically insert specific HTTP properties into your prompt:

* **\[HTTP_Requests\]:** Includes the complete HTTP request text.
* **\[HTTP_Requests_Headers\]:** Includes only the HTTP request headers.
* **\[HTTP_Requests_Parameters\]:** Includes the query string parameters from the HTTP request URL.
* **\[HTTP_Request_Body\]:** Includes the HTTP request body (if available).
* **\[HTTP_Responses\]:** Includes the complete HTTP response text.
* **\[HTTP_Response_Headers\]:** Includes only the HTTP response headers.
* **\[HTTP_Response_Body\]:** Includes the HTTP response body.

* **Author:** @bountysecurity  
* **Output Type:** Issue  
* **Severity:** High  
* **Confidence:** Firm  
* **System Prompt:**

        You are a web security expert specialized in vulnerability analysis. Analyze the provided HTTP requests and identify parameters that may be vulnerable to SQL injection, XSS, command injection, and other attacks. For each potential vulnerability, list the URL and the vulnerable parameter(s). If none are found, respond with "NONE".

* **User Prompt:**

        Please analyze the following HTTP request parameters for potential vulnerabilities. Output only the URL and the vulnerable parameter names in the following format:
        
        These are the URLs and parameters potentially vulnerable:
        - URL
